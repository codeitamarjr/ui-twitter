# My Twitter React App

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Itamar Junior. As part of my ongoing journey to master the React framework and to improve my JavaScript and CSS skills, I decided to build a clone of Twitter's user interface.

This project was completed in July 2023 and is aimed at demonstrating my grasp of front-end technologies, particularly ReactJS, JavaScript, and CSS. It's a standard React application which I built to re-create the Twitter interface, integrating the Phosphor Icons library and ensuring responsive design.

This project is a full clone of the popular social media platform Twitter, at least from the UI standpoint. It uses state management to simulate the behavior of posting tweets and responding to tweets.

The application utilizes Phosphor Icons to bring the interface to life and closely resemble Twitter's original design. I've also ensured that the interface is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on a wide range of devices, from mobile to desktop.
